Description: Contains functions to standardize fish otolith photographs and use 
  Deep Learning models to estimate the age from the standardized photographs. 
  The package currently works only for Greenland halibut and uses the models 
  developed by Martinsen et al. (2022) 
  <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277244> but may be extended for other 
  species and models in the future. The age estimation
  uses Python and the TensorFlow platform for machine learning.
